    <p>I am a second year User Experience Interactive Design student at Drexel University. I came from a background of biology and chemistry, but I found my calling with design the summer of 2023. Both science and art are respectable and intriguing fields, and it is the greatest honor to work in a field that incorporates both.
        I come from a Chinese-American background, and I would love to incorporate traditional cultural designs into my work in the future. I am a little bit of a multipotentialite, so I enjoy learning and trying new things!
        Some activities that I enjoy include creative writing, reading, and playing video games. In the future, I hope I can work to incorporate the things I like into my work!</p>
