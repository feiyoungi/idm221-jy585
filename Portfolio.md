## About Me

Hi, I’m **Fei Young** (she/her). It’s nice to meet you. 

I am a second year User Experience Interactive Design student at Drexel University. I came from a background of biology and chemistry, but I found my calling with design the summer of 2023. Both science and art are respectable and intriguing fields, and it is the greatest honor to work in a field that incorporates both. 

I come from a Chinese-American background, and I would love to incorporate traditional cultural designs into my work in the future. I am a little bit of a multipotentialite, so I enjoy learning and trying new things! 

Some activities that I enjoy include creative writing, reading, and playing video games. In the future, I hope I can work to incorporate the things I like into my work!

## Projects 

*Here are some things I've worked on!*

- The Kelpie Kitchen Mixer is named the Midnight Snacker, as it reflects the beauty and allure of the dark midnight stallion. This product design incorporates the black beauty/allure and the mutability powers of a Kelpie to expand the horizons for cooking.
